# Replication
This is mainly to play around with a few replication options for bobsled
1. Asynchronous-replication (single master & slave replicas)
2. Asynchronous-replication + Min ACKs (single master & slave replicas where replicas acknowledge when the've commited something)
3. Multi-master replication... Maybe with PAXOS (or RAFT for fun)
